# Build-a-Data-Lakehouse-with-Snowflake
### YouTube-Trending-Data-Analysis

## Project Objective
Digitalization has reshaped the entertainment industry, with YouTube leading the way as a video sharing platform for content creators to share creativity, while monetizing their work. The goal of this project is to build a data lakehouse, based on YouTubeâ€™s trending data using Azure for cloud storage and Snowflake for data processing and data analysis, additionally, to gain business insights into a content strategy for launching a successful YouTube Channel. 

### Analysis Precedures:
0. **Setup (Part 0)**: Setting up envoronment on both Azure and snowflake.
1. **Data Preparation (Part 1)**: Ingesting data into Snowflake from Azure Cloud Storage; Performing data cleaning to ensure the dataset is prepared for analysis. 
2. **Data Analysis (Part 2)**: Analyzing the results obtained from the cleaned data to explore YouTube trends across different countries and categories.
3. **Business Recommendations (Part 3)**: Utilizing insights to determine an optimal content category for launching a new YouTube channel, excluding "Music" and "Entertainment," and evaluates its potential success across different countries.

## Conclusion

This project has illustrated how data can be stored into cloud computing platform Azure and then transferred to the data platform Snowflake in its original form. Data engineers can then perform ETL processes within Snowflake to create well-structure datasets suitable for client-side data analysis. This approach provides an efficient, flexible and scalable for data processing. Moreover, it showcases strong capabilities of data lakehouse in facilitating data analysis and addressing business questions.
